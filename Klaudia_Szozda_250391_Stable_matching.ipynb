        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The **stable matching problem** was introduced by Gale and Shapley in 1962 using the marriage and college admissions models, and has since found applications far beyond these original settings. Similar mechanisms are used today in **recruitment systems**, **school admissions**, **hospital–resident assignments**, and many other allocation problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "We consider two equally sized groups:\n",
        "- `n` gentlemen and `n` ladies,\n",
        "- each person has a **strict (linear) preference order** over all members of the opposite group.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to create **perfect matchings** (everyone is matched) such that the result is **stable**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What Is Stability?\n",
        "\n",
        "Suppose the current matching contains the couples:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **John** is matched with **Lia**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Michael** is matched with **Emily**\n",
        "\n",
        "This pair is **unstable** if:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **John prefers Emily** over his current partner **Lia**, and\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Emily prefers John** over her current partner **Michael**\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though John and Emily are not matched to each other, they would both be happier together than in their current relationships. Therefore, (John, Emily) is an **unstable pair**, and the *matching is not stable*.\n",
        "\n",
        "If such a pair exists, the matching is *not stable*, because both would benefit from abandoning their current matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "A **stable matching** is a perfect matching that contains **no unstable pairs**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Preferences\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following example with four gentlemen and four ladies.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Gentlemen’s preferences\n",
        "`1 : a > b > c > d`\n",

        "\n",
        "## The Gale–Shapley Proposal Algorithm (1962)\n",
        "\n",
        "To systematically construct a stable matching, Gale and Shapley proposed a **proposal-based algorithm**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Algorithm Idea\n",
        "\n",
        "One side of the bipartition (here: gentlemen) actively proposes, while the other side (ladies) responds.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step-by-step Procedure\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Each unengaged man proposes** to the most preferred woman who has not yet rejected him.\n",
        "2. **Each woman considers all proposals** she receives:\n",
        "   - If she receives only one proposal, she keeps it (temporarly).\n",
        "   - If she receives multiple proposals, she **keeps the best one** according to her preferences and **rejects all others**.\n",
        "3. Rejected men move on and propose again in the next round.\n",
        "4. The process repeats until **everyone is engaged**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, engagements are *temporary* until the algorithm finishes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "### **Round 1**\n",
        "\n",
        "Each unengaged man proposes to his top choice:\n",
        "\n",
        "1 → a\n",
        "\n",
        "2 → a\n",
        "\n",
        "3 → c\n",
        "\n",
        "4 → c\n",
        "\n",
        "Now each woman considers the proposals she received:\n",
        "\n",
        "a receives proposals from 1 and 2\n",
        "→ she prefers 1, so she tentatively accepts 1 and rejects 2\n",
        "\n",
        "c receives proposals from 3 and 4\n",
        "→ she prefers 4, so she tentatively accepts 4 and rejects 3\n",
        "\n",
        "b and d receive no proposals\n",
        "\n",
        "Tentative engagements after Round 1:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1, a)\n",

        "Rejected men: 2, 3\n",

        "\n",
        "## How the Algorithm Works (Intuition)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Men gradually “work down” their preference lists.\n",
        "- Women always hold onto the **best proposal they have seen so far**.\n",
        "- Once a woman rejects a man, she will **never accept him later**, because she already has (or will have) a better option.\n",
        "\n",
        "This monotonic behavior guarantees progress and termination.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why the Algorithm Produces a Stable Matching\n",
        "\n",
        "### Termination\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each man proposes to each woman **at most once**.\n",
        "- There are finitely many proposals (`n²` at most), so the algorithm must terminate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stability Proof (Idea)\n",
        "\n",
        "Assume, for contradiction, that the final matching contains an unstable pair `(John, Emily)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `John` prefers `Emily` over his assigned partner.\n",
        "- Therefore, `John` must have proposed to `Emily` **before** proposing to his final partner.\n",
        "- If `Emily` rejected `John`, it means she was holding a proposal from someone she preferred more.\n",
        "- Since women only “trade up,” her final partner must be **at least as good** as that proposer.\n",
        "- Hence, `Emily` cannot prefer `John` over her final partner — contradiction.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, no unstable pair can exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Properties of the Gale–Shapley Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Always finds a stable matching**, regardless of preferences.\n",
        "- **Simple and decentralized** — each participant only needs their own preference list.\n",
        "- **Widely applicable** (e.g. school admissions, job matching).\n",
        "- The algorithm is **biased in favor of the proposing side**:\n",
        "  - Proposers get their *best possible* stable partners.\n",
        "  - The receiving side gets their *worst* stable partners.\n",
        "- There may be **multiple stable matchings**, but this algorithm finds one extreme solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "The stable matching problem captures a fundamental challenge in fair allocation systems.  \n",
        "The Gale–Shapley algorithm provides a powerful and elegant solution that guarantees stability, efficiency, and practical usability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its simplicity, it remains one of the most influential algorithms in economics, computer science, and operations research.\n"
