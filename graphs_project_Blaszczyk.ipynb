    "An undirected graph is **Eulerian** if it is connected and **all vertices have even degree**. In this case, there exists an Euler circuit, i.e. a closed walk that uses every edge exactly once.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section we show how **Prüfer codes** can be applied to a tree obtained from the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we run Dijkstra’s algorithm from a chosen start vertex. Besides distances, Dijkstra also returns a **predecessor dictionary** `pred`, which describes a **shortest-path tree** rooted at the start vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this predecessor dictionary we explicitly **construct the corresponding tree** as a `Graph` object. This tree contains exactly the edges that form the shortest paths from the root to all other reachable vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we apply the `Prufer()` method to this tree to compute its **Prüfer code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dijkstra’s algorithm does not only compute distances, but also defines a **tree structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every tree can be encoded uniquely by a **Prüfer code**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This shows how shortest-path trees can be **encoded and represented compactly**"
