    "\n",
    "In this section we show how **Prüfer codes** can be applied to a tree obtained from the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we run Dijkstra’s algorithm from a chosen start vertex. Besides distances, Dijkstra also returns a **predecessor dictionary** `pred`, which describes a **shortest-path tree** rooted at the start vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this predecessor dictionary we explicitly **construct the corresponding tree** as a `Graph` object. This tree contains exactly the edges that form the shortest paths from the root to all other reachable vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we apply the `Prufer()` method to this tree to compute its **Prüfer code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dijkstra’s algorithm does not only compute distances, but also defines a **tree structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every tree can be encoded uniquely by a **Prüfer code**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This shows how shortest-path trees can be **encoded and represented compactly**"

    "In this chapter, the greedy matching heuristic used in the initial version of the project was compared with two optimal methods:\n",
    "a Hungarian-algorithm-based approach and an exact dynamic programming (DP) solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the main test graph, all three methods produced identical results, which shows that in some practical cases the greedy\n",
    "heuristic is sufficient and achieves the optimal solution. The optimal methods serve there as a verification of the correctness\n",
    "of the greedy result.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the constructed counterexample clearly demonstrated that greedy matching does not guarantee optimality and may lead\n",
    "to significantly worse solutions. In that case, both the Hungarian-based method and the exact DP algorithm correctly found the\n",
    "globally optimal pairing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hungarian-based method and the DP algorithm always produce the same optimal results, which confirms their correctness.\n",
    "Due to the exponential complexity of the exact DP algorithm, it is only feasible for small instances and mainly serves as a\n",
    "reference solution. In contrast, the greedy heuristic is very fast and can be used as a practical approximation method when\n",
    "optimality is not strictly required.\n"
